      <div class='line'>When the Norn-Mother saw the Whirlwind Hour,</div>
      <div class='line'>Greatening and darkening as it hurried on,</div>
      <div class='line'>She bent the strenuous Heavens and came down</div>
      <div class='line'>To make a man to meet the mortal need.</div>
      <div class='line'>She took the tried clay of the common road—</div>
      <div class='line'>Clay warm yet with the genial heat of Earth,</div>
      <div class='line'>Dashed through it all a strain of prophecy;</div>
      <div class='line'>Then mixed a laughter with the serious stuff.</div>
      <div class='line'>It was a stuff to wear for centuries,</div>
      <div class='line'>A man that matched the mountains, and compelled</div>

      <div class='line'>The gladness of the wind that shakes the corn;</div>
      <div class='line'>The courage of the bird that dares the sea;</div>
      <div class='line'>The justice of the rain that loves all leaves;</div>
      <div class='line'>The pity of the snow that hides all scars;</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>The loving-kindness of the wayside well;</div>
      <div class='line'>The tolerance and equity of light</div>
      <div class='line'>That gives as freely to the shrinking weed</div>

      <div class='line'>To the grave’s low hill as to the Matterhorn</div>
      <div class='line'>That shoulders out the sky.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>

      <div class='line'>From prairie cabin up to Capitol,</div>
      <div class='line'>One fair Ideal led our chieftain on.</div>
      <div class='line'>Forevermore he burned to do his deed</div>
      <div class='line'>With the fine stroke and gesture of a king.</div>
      <div class='line'>He built the rail-pile as he built the State,</div>
      <div class='line'>Pouring his splendid strength through every blow,</div>
      <div class='line'>The conscience of him testing every stroke,</div>
      <div class='line'>To make his deed the measure of a man.</div>

    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>So came the Captain with the mighty heart:</div>

      <div class='line'>Wrenching the rafters from their ancient hold,</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>He held the ridgepole up, and spiked again</div>
      <div class='line'>The rafters of the Home. He held his place—</div>
      <div class='line'>Held the long purpose like a growing tree—</div>
      <div class='line'>Held on through blame and faltered not at praise.</div>
      <div class='line'>And when he fell in whirlwind, he went down</div>
      <div class='line'>As when a kingly cedar green with boughs</div>
      <div class='line'>Goes down with a great shout upon the hills,</div>
      <div class='line'>And leaves a lonesome place against the sky.</div>

      <div class='line'>Who loved the work-worn multitude whose pillow is a stone,</div>

      <div class='line'>She bent to lift, for in her blood ran some heroic strain</div>

      <div class='line'>Queen of a hundred legends, star of a misty past,</div>

    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>It was upon a Christmas eve, and all the world was white</div>

      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>And green boughs bended with hoar weight, and under them the birds</div>
      <div class='line'>Huddled together, making friends with little hornèd herds.</div>
      <div class='line'>And far from soundless gorges in the soundless forest deep,</div>
      <div class='line'>The wild boar humped up closer in the hollow of his heap;</div>
      <div class='line'>And workers huddled in their huts among the stiffened trees,</div>
      <div class='line'>The doorstones blue with ice, the eaves with frosty filigrees.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>And Horsel’s peak hung ghostly still upon the wintry sky,</div>
      <div class='line'>But Wartburg’s castle-hall was filled with many a joyous cry,</div>

      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>For now within a happy hour the banquet must be laid.</div>
      <div class='line'>Pert pages in their purfled shoes went twinkling in and out,</div>

      <div class='line'>Elizabeth was there above, among her maiden band,</div>

      <div class='line'>(O serving queen, I honor thee—queen of a day gone down,</div>

      <div class='line'>Came onward like the tumult of white barley in the breeze;</div>
      <div class='line'>Then young Elizabeth the Moon, leading her Pleiades!</div>
      <div class='line'>Their robes were shot with thread of gold that into blossom broke,</div>

      <div class='line'>And Kinga, tallest of the seven, and by her side the bard,</div>
      <div class='line'>Gray Vogelweide, the lyric swan, telling with flash of youth,</div>
      <div class='line'>How once he stood against the world for Hungary and truth—</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>How singing in this knightly hall, circled by courtly throng,</div>
      <div class='line'>He fought the star of Austria in Wartburg’s War of Song.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Then the young sovereign Lewis and his guests swept glowing in—</div>
      <div class='line'>Lord, liegeman, shaggy baron, gallant knight and paladin,</div>

      <div class='line'>Dark Rudolph home from Holy War with Lion Richard’s praise;</div>
      <div class='line'>Walter the Falconer, and Franz, the flower of Hesse’s men,</div>

      <div class='line'>Up from the chimney log the notes of many woodlands sang;</div>
      <div class='line'>Quick through the flame the colors of a hundred summers sprang.</div>
      <div class='line'>The blaze threw on the arrased wall a gush of golden light,</div>

      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>Forever moving upward toward the cherubs overhead,</div>

      <div class='line'>A swinging door, a spicy smell, and beaming Hugolin</div>
      <div class='line'>With smoking boar’s head lifted high came proudly panting in.</div>
      <div class='line'>And as the sparkling feast went on the board began to stir</div>
      <div class='line'>With talk of knightly valor and the Holy Sepulchre,</div>
      <div class='line'>With prattle of the tidings from Jerusalem and Rome;</div>
      <div class='line'>But sweet Elizabeth, her thoughts were not so far from home.</div>
      <div class='line'>In spite of rosy radiance, in spite of trumpet calls,</div>
      <div class='line'>The Sorrow of the People sent its shadow through the walls.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>For sitting there beside her lord a sudden silence came</div>
      <div class='line'>Upon her soul, and all the voices and the horn’s acclaim</div>
      <div class='line'>Died; and the glowing pageant broke and faded into air,</div>
      <div class='line'>And only the faces of the poor whose tables are so bare</div>
      <div class='line'>Pressed in upon her soul that night, pressed in that gala night;</div>
      <div class='line'>Only the toilers’ cheerless homes rose on her inward sight.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>And then a graver thought let in a darkness on her heart—</div>
      <div class='line'>A thought of all the feasts they spread of which they have no part—</div>
      <div class='line'>A thought, too, of this splendor on this holy Christmas eve,</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>A splendor wrung from toiling hands by those that tax and thieve.</div>
      <div class='line'>Of all those fragrant dishes only two would not profane;</div>
      <div class='line'>Only the bread and water there had come of honest gain;</div>
      <div class='line'>These only were not pilfered from the toiler’s lean supply;</div>
      <div class='line'>And these she took with happy hands, but let the rest go by.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>And so the table roared away into the winter night,</div>
      <div class='line'>Until the toasts went round the board with laughter at the height.</div>
      <div class='line'>They drank to saints and prophets old, to Peter and Isadore,</div>
      <div class='line'>To Stephen, Vincent, Boniface, and to a dozen more.</div>
      <div class='line'>Then valiant Wolfram in his turn upstarted with a cry:</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>“Drink to Archangel Michael, that good fighter in the sky,</div>
      <div class='line'>That prince of God that all the hosts of Satan could not tame!”</div>
      <div class='line'>Up to their feet the feasters sprang at that great angel’s name.</div>
      <div class='line'>Clinking their cups from side to side, they made, in the torches’ flare,</div>
      <div class='line'>The sign of the cross with their jewelled cups high flashing in the air.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Now cried the duke: “Not all the saints have felt the wind of death;</div>
      <div class='line'>Come, drink to one who walks the Earth, my wife Elizabeth;</div>
      <div class='line'>And I will pledge her beauty with this water in her cup.”</div>
      <div class='line'>So stooping down he caught and swung her golden goblet up,</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>And tasted—paused—tasted again, for lo, it was rare wine!</div>
      <div class='line'>More strangely sweet than any juice pressed from an earthly vine.</div>
      <div class='line'>“Ho, varlet, from what pipe this wine and from what cellar shelf?”</div>
      <div class='line'>“From good Saint Kilian’s well, sire, and I drew it up myself!”</div>
      <div class='line'>She flushed; the table stared; the duke looked foolishly about,</div>
      <div class='line'>The hall so still they heard far bells breaking the night without.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Then up spake Helias the Seer: “I saw the water poured—</div>
      <div class='line'>Saw, too, an angel bending by our lady at the board,</div>
      <div class='line'>Pouring with courteous gesture from a flagon of red wine,</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>Then fading in the brightness of the firelight’s dancing shine.”</div>
      <div class='line'>She heard in glad amaze: he wins God’s favor unawares</div>

      <div class='line'>Friar Hilary, of Barbizon,</div>
      <div class='line'>(Rest to his soul where his soul has gone!)</div>
      <div class='line'>Was a man whose life was long perplexed</div>
      <div class='line'>By pious juggles with the text.</div>
      <div class='line'>The logic of St. Thomas’ books</div>
      <div class='line'>Was fastened to his mind with hooks.</div>
      <div class='line'>He knew Tertullian’s work complete—</div>
      <div class='line'>That treatise on the Paraclete.</div>
      <div class='line'>He knew the words Chrysostom hurled</div>
      <div class='line'>In golden thunder on the world;</div>
      <div class='line'>And he could commentate and quote</div>
      <div class='line'>The thirteen books Saint Cyril wrote.</div>
      <div class='line'>The controversies of Jerome,</div>
      <div class='line'>He could recite them, tome by tome.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>The friar was tall and spare and spent,</div>
      <div class='line'>Like a cedar of Lebanon bare and bent.</div>
      <div class='line'>His eyes were sunken and burned too bright,</div>
      <div class='line'>Like restless stars in the pit of night.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>The friar had built a tower of stone,</div>
      <div class='line'>And dwelt far up in a cell alone;</div>
      <div class='line'>And from the turret, gray in air,</div>
      <div class='line'>He called to God with psalm and prayer,</div>
      <div class='line'>To come as he did to the wise of old—</div>
      <div class='line'>To come as the ancient voice foretold.</div>
      <div class='line'>All day the hawk swung overhead;</div>
      <div class='line'>All day the holy page was read.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>One bleak December he fasted sore,</div>
      <div class='line'>That Christ might knock at his low door—</div>
      <div class='line'>Lord Jesus shine across the floor.</div>
      <div class='line'>For he was hungry to be fed</div>
      <div class='line'>With the holy love, with the mystic bread.</div>
      <div class='line'>Yet Christ came not to sup with him,</div>
      <div class='line'>And Christmas Eve fell chilly and dim.</div>
      <div class='line'>“Where art Thou?” he would cry and hark,</div>
      <div class='line'>While echoes answered in the dark....</div>

    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>Now suddenly there came a cry</div>
      <div class='line'>As of a mortal like to die.</div>
      <div class='line'>Up sprang the friar, the doors of oak</div>
      <div class='line'>He flung asunder at a stroke.</div>
      <div class='line'>Down stair by stair his quick feet flew,</div>
      <div class='line'>Startling the owls that the rafters knew,</div>
      <div class='line'>Breaking the webs that barred the way,</div>
      <div class='line'>Crushing the mosses that fear the day.</div>
      <div class='line'>Into the pitiless street he ran</div>
      <div class='line'>To find a stricken fellow-man,</div>
      <div class='line'>And carry him in upon his breast,</div>
      <div class='line'>With many a halt on the stairs for rest.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>He washed the feet and stroked the hair,</div>
      <div class='line'>And for the once forgot his prayer.</div>
      <div class='line'>He gave him wine that the Pope had sent</div>
      <div class='line'>For some great day of the Sacrament;</div>
      <div class='line'>And looking up, behold, at his side</div>
      <div class='line'>Was bending also the Crucified!</div>
      <div class='line'>He had come at last to the lonesome place,</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>And standing there with a courteous grace,</div>

    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>And then the Master said: “My son,</div>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
